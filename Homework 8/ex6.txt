A machine has 16-bit virtual addresses.
Pages are 8 KB. How many entries are
needed for a single-level linear page
table?

Due to that pages are 8KB, offset is 13 bits. 
This means that we have 16-13=3 bits to identify the pages.
Therefore (2)^3 = 8 pages are possible 
Then a page table must have 8 entries.
